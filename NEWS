statnet.common 4.1.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   `despace()` removes whitespace from a string.

-   Pseudo-methods `colMeans.mcmc.list()`, `sweep.mcmc.list()`, and
    `lapply.mcmc.list()` (migrated from the `ergm` package).

-   `filter_rhs.formula()` selectively deletes terms in on the RHS of a
    formula.

-   `eval_lhs.formula()` extracts the LHS of the formula and evaluates
    it in the specified environment.

-   `NVL2()` and `NVL3()` for flexible substitution of null values.

-   `message_print()` formats its arguments as if for `print()` or
    `show()` methods, but then prints to stderr like `message()`.

Enhancements to existing utilities
----------------------------------

-   `paste.and()` now takes an additional `con=` argument, allowing a
    conjunction other than "and" to be used.

-   `ERRVL()` now uses lazy evaluation and lets the user dot-substitute
    the previous argument's try-error into the next argument.

Bug fixes
---------

-   Printing for control lists now works for function arguments.

-   A number of improvements to `rle` methods.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-   A number of functions have been renamed for consistency:
    -   `term.list.formula()` → `list_rhs.formula()`
    -   `append.rhs.formula()` → `append_rhs.formula()`
    -   `nonsimp.update.formula()` → `nonsimp_update.formula()`

statnet.common 4.0.0
====================

-   The package now uses `Roxygen` for documentation.

-   `term.list.formula()` output format has been changed, since support
    of attributes on symbols is being deprecated.

-   A library of methods has been added for the base `rle` class,
    implementing concatenation, compaction, and a number of binary
    operations.

-   `all_same()` has been moved from ergm and renamed to
    `all_identical()`.

-   A new assignment method `NVL()<-` overwrites a variable if its value
    is NULL.

-   A set of classes and functions for manipulating and efficiently
    performing calculations on dense matrices or vectors with weighted
    rows or elements (possibly on the log scale) has been added.

-   New control parameter helper function, control.remap() has been
    added. Autodetection of function names by `set.control.class()` and
    `check.control.class()` has been deprecated and now results in a
    warning.

-   Improvements to the compressed data frame code, including an order()
    generic.

-   Miscellaneous robustifications added.

-   Native routine registration has been added.

statnet.common 3.3.0
====================

-   `append.rhs.formula()`, `vectors.namesmatch()`,
    `term.list.formula()`, and `ergm.update.formula()` (renamed to
    `nosimp.update.formula()`) moved from `ergm`.

-   Skye Bender-deMoll has been added as a contributor.

statnet.common 3.2.3
====================

-   `ERRVL()` moved from `ergm`.

-   Some `NAMESPACE` and other fixes to pass CRAN checks.

statnet.common 3.2.2
====================

-   control class improvements and bug fixes.

statnet.common 3.1.1
====================

-   Updated e-mail address

-   Some improvements to opttest.

statnet.common 3.1.0
====================

-   Initial release, incorporating the control class framework
    (`set.control.class()`, `check.control.class()`,
    `print.control.list()`); startup message framework; `NVL()`;
    `sort.data.frame()`; `compress.data.frame()`; `paste.and()`;
    citation utilities framework; and `opttest()` framework.
