statnet.common 4.10.0
=====================

-   `as.cntrol.list.list()` and hence `snctrl()` no longer clobbers
    nested controls, e.g., `control.ergm(SAN=control.san(...),...)`.
-   To facilitate support for earlier versions of R, avoid using the
    built-in pipe (`|>`) for now.
-   New linear algebra utilities: `ginv_eigen()`, which performs
    generalised inverse via eigendecomposition rather than SVD, to be
    used by `sginv()` if `snnd=TRUE`; and `xTAx_eigen()` and
    `xTAx_seigen()` to evaluate the inverse quadratic form using
    eigendecomposition.
-   `lweighted.var()` and `lweighted.cov()` now take an additional
    argument `onerow=` to specify what they should return (`NA`, 0, or
    something else) if the input matrix has one row.
-   A new function `var.mcmc.list()` "method" to evaluate the covariance
    matrix for an `mcmc.list` without constructing a large matrix.
-   `colMeans.mcmc.list()` "method" no longer constructs a large matrix
    when calculating.

statnet.common 4.9.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   A new function,`lweighted.cov()`, to compute weighted covariance
    between two matrices or vectors.
-   New linear algebra utilities, `is.SPD()`, `sandwich_solve()`,
    `sandwich_ssolve()`, `sginv()`, `snearPD()`, `srcond()`, `ssolve()`,
    `xAxT()`, `xTAx()`, `xTAx_qrsolve()`, `xTAx_qrssolve()`,
    `xTAx_solve()`, and `xTAx_ssolve()` moved from `ergm` and
    documented.

Bug fixes
---------

-   In `handle.controls()`, arguments that are `match.arg()`-ed are now
    evaluated in the correct frame.

statnet.common 4.8.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   A helper function `unused_dots_warning()` is exported that works
    with `rlang::check_dots_used()` to print an informative message.

statnet.common 4.7.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   An S3 class `term_list` for storing terms extracted from a formula,
    by `list_rhs.formula()` and others, containing information about
    each term's sign and environment. Concatenation, indexing, and print
    methods are implemented.

Bug fixes
---------

-   `list_rhs.formula()` can now handle `NULL` terms on the RHS.

statnet.common 4.6.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   An implementation of Welford's online algorithm for calculating
    sample mean and variance has been added as a class `Welford` that
    implements method `update()` and maintains elements `$n`, `$means`,
    `$SSDs`, and `$vars`.

Bug fixes
---------

-   `snctrl()` was issuing a warning twice when called with a misspelled
    argument.

-   `deInf()` now handles `NULL` input.

-   in `locate_function()` a subtle bug has been fixed in handling of
    visible as opposed to invisible objects.

statnet.common 4.5.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   `ergm`'s term locator functions (`locate_function()` and
    `locate_prefixed_function()`) have been moved from `ergm`.

-   A new function, `default_options()`, a wrapper around `options()`
    that drops options already set.

-   A new function, `as.control.list()` generic and methods which take
    an R list and call an appropriate `control.*()` function on it.

-   `check.control.class()` now first runs the control argument through
    `as.control.list()` and overwrites, so `control=` arguments to many
    functions can be plain lists.

-   A new function, `simplify_simple()`, which takes a list and returns
    an atomic vector if the elements of the list are atomic and of
    length 1, with particular handling for `NULL` and empty (0-length)
    elements.

-   A new function, `snctrl()` (StatNet ConTRoL), designed so that
    argument completion will complete all available control functions.
    Looking up its help (`?snctrl`) produces a dynamic list of all
    control parameters and their packages and control functions that is
    updated as packages are loaded and unloaded.

-   A new function, `handle.controls()`, that performs the most normal
    functions in a `control.*()` function.

-   Two trivial helper functions, `base_env()` and `empty_env()`, to
    replace an object's environment with `baseenv()` and `emptyenv()`,
    respectively.

-   A new function, `fixed.pval()` that wraps `base::format.pval()` with
    better default arguments.

-   A reimplementation of `attr()` is exported, which disables partial
    matching by default.

Enhancements to existing utilities
----------------------------------

-   `statnetStartupMessage()` now first looks for a
    `comment=(affil=...)` for the contributor's affiliation, before
    using e-mail.

-   Improved output formatting for `.Deprecate_once()`.

-   `append_rhs.formula()` now accepts NULL as the first argument, in
    which case it creates a new formula, and takes an additonal argument
    `env=`, which is used as this new formula's environment.

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------

-   `rle` utilities are no longer reexported.

-   `statnet.common` no longer depends on `purrr`.

-   `statnetStartupMessage()` has been simplified.

statnet.common 4.4.0
====================

`rle` utilities have been moved to a separate package, `rle`
------------------------------------------------------------

-   Major methods are reexported, for now.

New utilities
-------------

-   `split()` methods for matrices and arrays, to split them along a
    margin.

-   `trim_env()`, a generic that will replace an environment (possibly
    attached to another object) with a sub-environment containing only
    objects whose names are specified.

-   A `diff()` method for control lists and a `print()` method for the
    resulting differences.

-   `deInf()`, to replace `.deinf()` in package `ergm`.

-   A `compress()` generic, a `compress()` method for RLEs, and a
    `doNotCompress` argument to `rep.rle()`. Both `compact.rle()` and
    the `doNotCompact` argument to `rep.rle()` are now deprecated.

Enhancements to existing utilities
----------------------------------

-   Various optimizations have been made to RLEs.

-   `nonsimp_update.formula()` now handles both one and two sided
    formulas; it also now copies all names except `...` when
    `from.new = TRUE`.

Bug fixes
---------

-   `str.rle()` now works despite the overridden `length()` method.

statnet.common 4.3.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   `EVL()`, a family of functions like `NVL()`, that treat any object
    of length 0 as `NULL`.

-   `once()`, a `purrr`-style adverb that wraps a function to only
    evaluate the first time it's called with a given configuration of
    arguments.

-   `persistEval()` and `persistEvalQ()` to retry evaluating a given
    expression a specified number of times.

Bug fixes
---------

-   In `forkTimeout()`, don't collect a process twice. Thanks to Tomas
    Kalibera for suggesting the fix.

statnet.common 4.2.0
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   `.Deprecate_once()` calls `.Deprecated()`, passing all its arguments
    through, but only the first time it's called.

-   `.Deprecate_method()` calls `.Deprecated()`, but only if a method
    has been called by name, i.e., `METHOD.CLASS`.

-   `forkTimeout()` evaluates an R expression with a hard time limit
    (except on Windows) by forking a process. Unlike `setTimeLimit()`,
    it enforces the limit even on native code.

-   `ult()` is a convenience function that extracts or replaces elements
    of a list indexed from the end.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-   `statnet.common` now depends on R \>= 3.5 due to what appears to be
    a method dispatching bug in earlier versions.

-   The package no longer Enhances `coda`.

statnet.common 4.1.4
====================

New utilities
-------------

-   `despace()` removes whitespace from a string.

-   Pseudo-methods `colMeans.mcmc.list()`, `sweep.mcmc.list()`, and
    `lapply.mcmc.list()` (migrated from the `ergm` package).

-   `filter_rhs.formula()` selectively deletes terms in on the RHS of a
    formula.

-   `eval_lhs.formula()` extracts the LHS of the formula and evaluates
    it in the specified environment.

-   `NVL2()` and `NVL3()` for flexible substitution of null values.

-   `message_print()` formats its arguments as if for `print()` or
    `show()` methods, but then prints to stderr like `message()`.

Enhancements to existing utilities
----------------------------------

-   `paste.and()` now takes an additional `con=` argument, allowing a
    conjunction other than "and" to be used.

-   `ERRVL()` now uses lazy evaluation and lets the user dot-substitute
    the previous argument's try-error into the next argument.

Bug fixes
---------

-   Printing for control lists now works for function arguments.

-   A number of improvements to `rle` methods.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-   A number of functions have been renamed for consistency:
    -   `term.list.formula()` → `list_rhs.formula()`
    -   `append.rhs.formula()` → `append_rhs.formula()`
    -   `nonsimp.update.formula()` → `nonsimp_update.formula()`
-   Citation utilities have been deprecated, since CRAN's structure
    makes them unusable.

statnet.common 4.0.0
====================

-   The package now uses `Roxygen` for documentation.

-   `term.list.formula()` output format has been changed, since support
    of attributes on symbols is being deprecated.

-   A library of methods has been added for the base `rle` class,
    implementing concatenation, compaction, and a number of binary
    operations.

-   `all_same()` has been moved from ergm and renamed to
    `all_identical()`.

-   A new assignment method `NVL()<-` overwrites a variable if its value
    is NULL.

-   A set of classes and functions for manipulating and efficiently
    performing calculations on dense matrices or vectors with weighted
    rows or elements (possibly on the log scale) has been added.

-   New control parameter helper function, control.remap() has been
    added. Autodetection of function names by `set.control.class()` and
    `check.control.class()` has been deprecated and now results in a
    warning.

-   Improvements to the compressed data frame code, including an order()
    generic.

-   Miscellaneous robustifications added.

-   Native routine registration has been added.

statnet.common 3.3.0
====================

-   `append.rhs.formula()`, `vectors.namesmatch()`,
    `term.list.formula()`, and `ergm.update.formula()` (renamed to
    `nosimp.update.formula()`) moved from `ergm`.

-   Skye Bender-deMoll has been added as a contributor.

statnet.common 3.2.3
====================

-   `ERRVL()` moved from `ergm`.

-   Some `NAMESPACE` and other fixes to pass CRAN checks.

statnet.common 3.2.2
====================

-   control class improvements and bug fixes.

    (`set.control.class()`, `check.control.class()`,
    `print.control.list()`); startup message framework; `NVL()`;
    `sort.data.frame()`; `compress.data.frame()`; `paste.and()`;
    citation utilities framework; and `opttest()` framework.
